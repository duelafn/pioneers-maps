Pioneers (formerly Gno-Catan) scenarios and map generating tools

Some existing resorces:
  Random map generator: http://pio.sourceforge.net/contrib/random-gen.c
  Map randomizer: http://pio.sourceforge.net/contrib/map-randomizer.c

Though, I will probably re-implement those in Perl for fun.


And, of course, the pioneers website has some other useful resources:
